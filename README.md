Ninth and final iteration of Thinkful FEWD capstone project.

In this case, a personal portfolio. It's been a very long time coming, interspersed with Search and Rescues, late night trials and everything in between. Plus I've been my own worst enemy, wanting to try new things. 

Repos Personal_Portfolio and SunilUnka contain my first iterations of attempts, trying to create something unique, but the concept was not really UI friendly, didn't give the gist (Gotta learn to condense and make stuff succint.) This still needs some polish, but I've learnt a lot - heaps to be honest over the whole course. 


-> Big thanks to Morgan Nixon of Thinkful for all his help (and putting up with me!), wouldn't have been possible without your 
guidance.
